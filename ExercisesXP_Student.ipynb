        "Precision measures how many of the predicted positives were actually positive — important when false alarms are costly.\n",
        "Recall measures how many real positives the model caught — critical when missing a positive case is expensive (like missing a fraudster or a defaulter).\n",
        "F1-Score balances precision and recall into one number, useful when both matter.\n",
        "ROC-AUC plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate across all thresholds. A score above 0.85 generally indicates a strong model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Challenges\n",
        "The biggest challenge in supervised learning evaluation is class imbalance — if 95% of your data belongs to one class, a model predicting that class every time scores 95% accuracy while being completely useless. Another challenge is data leakage, where information from the test set accidentally influences training, making results artificially optimistic.\n",

        "2. Unsupervised Learning — K-Means Clustering\n",
        "Model Choice\n",
        "K-Means is a natural fit for tasks like grouping customers by behavior, organizing documents by topic, or segmenting products — situations where no labels exist and you want to discover hidden structure.\n",
        "Evaluation Strategy\n",
        "Since there are no labels to compare against, you evaluate unsupervised models by measuring the internal quality of the clusters themselves.\n",
        "The Elbow Method helps you choose the right number of clusters (k). You run K-Means for k=1, 2, 3, … n and plot the inertia (sum of distances from each point to its cluster center) against k. The curve bends sharply at the optimal k, forming an \"elbow\" — this is where adding more clusters stops meaningfully improving the groupings.\n",
        "The Silhouette Score evaluates how well each data point fits its assigned cluster compared to neighboring clusters. The score ranges from -1 to +1, where a score close to +1 means the point is well matched to its cluster and far from others, a score near 0 means it sits on a boundary, and a negative score means it may have been assigned to the wrong cluster. You want an average silhouette score as high as possible.\n",
        "Visual inspection using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or t-SNE allows you to plot clusters in 2D and visually confirm that they are well separated and meaningful.\n",
        "Challenges\n",
        "The core challenge is that there is no ground truth to validate against — you cannot calculate accuracy or F1-score. Evaluation is inherently subjective, and two different analysts might prefer different numbers of clusters. K-Means also assumes clusters are roughly spherical and equal in size, which is often not true in real data, making it sensitive to outliers and poorly shaped groups.\n",

        "3. Reinforcement Learning — Q-Learning (Maze Navigation)\n",
        "Model Choice\n",
        "Q-Learning is a classic reinforcement learning algorithm well suited to navigation and decision-making tasks, such as training a robot to find the shortest path through a maze. The agent learns a table of values (Q-values) representing the expected future reward of each action in each state.\n",
        "Evaluation Strategy\n",
        "Cumulative reward is the primary metric. After each training episode (one complete attempt at the maze), you sum all the rewards and penalties the agent received. Over time, you expect this number to increase as the agent learns better strategies. A stable, high cumulative reward signals that the agent has learned an effective policy.\n",
        "Convergence tells you whether the agent has finished learning. You monitor the Q-values across episodes — when they stop changing significantly between episodes, the model has converged and found a stable policy. Plotting the reward per episode over time should show an upward trend that eventually flattens.\n",
        "Exploration vs. exploitation balance is controlled by the epsilon (ε) parameter. Early in training, epsilon is high, meaning the agent tries random actions to explore the environment. Over time, epsilon decreases so the agent relies more on what it has already learned. Monitoring how epsilon decays and how it affects reward progression is an important part of evaluating whether training is healthy.\n",
        "Path quality is a task-specific metric: once training is complete, you measure the actual length of the path the agent takes and compare it to the known optimal path (shortest possible path). A well-trained agent should get very close to optimal.\n",
        "Challenges\n",
        "Reinforcement learning is particularly hard to evaluate because results are highly sensitive to hyperparameters like the learning rate, discount factor, and epsilon decay schedule. A poorly tuned agent may appear to converge but actually be stuck in a suboptimal policy. Another challenge is sample efficiency — the agent may need millions of episodes to learn a good policy, which is computationally expensive. Finally, performance in a simulated training environment does not always transfer to the real world, a problem known as the sim-to-real gap."
